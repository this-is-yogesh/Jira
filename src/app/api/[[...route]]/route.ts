we are  creating an authentication route = " /auth/login ", which handles login requests by validating the user's input (email and password) using zvalidator.
This API is then hooked into Vercel to be deployed as a serverless function.
we can use AWS LAMBDA also for serverless function which is Similar to Vercelâ€™s serverless, where we can integrate with other AWS or Google Cloud services.
Requires some configuration and might not be as seamless as Vercel, but gives more granular control
